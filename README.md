## Cybersecurity Portfolio

I’m building a security-focused GitHub that tells a clear story for SOC/IR roles.
Most of my work is **offline-first documentation and writeups** (case studies, detections, policies), backed by hands-on labs and projects.

### Security (primary)
1. [SOC Lab](https://github.com/Archer7Mi/soc-lab) – Detection & alert simulations
2. [SC-200 Case Studies](https://github.com/Archer7Mi/security-portfolio/tree/main/SC-200) – KQL, hunting, incident response
3. [ISO27001 Docs](https://github.com/Archer7Mi/security-portfolio/tree/main/ISO27001) – Policies, SoA, risk register

### Projects (engineering)
1. [Invictus Dashboard](https://github.com/Archer7Mi/invictus-dashboard) – Data visualization & automation
2. IRIS Simulator – Offensive security learning platform (link coming soon)

### Fitness (apps & tools)
1. Super Gym App – Training plans + tracking (link coming soon)
2. Lead Magnet Calculators – Calories/macros/performance (link coming soon)
