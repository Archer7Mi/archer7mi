# Hi, I'm Ted N — Aspiring Cybersecurity Analyst & Tech Creator

Welcome to my GitHub! Here, I showcase my hands-on experience in **cybersecurity**, **software projects**, and **fitness tech apps**.
This portfolio is organized to tell a clear story of skill, initiative, and problem-solving.

## Security (Primary Focus)

These repositories highlight my **SOC operations, threat detection, and governance work**. They reflect what I’m learning and building across SC-200, Splunk, ISO 27001, and incident response.

| Repo | What you’ll see |
|------|----------------|
| [soc-lab](https://github.com/Archer7Mi/soc-lab) | Simulated SOC environment, detection scenarios, log analysis. |
| [applicationsecurity-lab](https://github.com/Archer7Mi/applicationsecurity-lab) | OWASP testing, vulnerability assessments, secure coding experiments. |
| [risk-access-identity](https://github.com/Archer7Mi/risk-access-identity) | IAM controls, access/risk workflows, security engineering labs. |
| [security-engineer-projects](https://github.com/Archer7Mi/security-engineer-projects) | Practical security engineering projects (automation, monitoring, tooling). |
| [ISO27001 docs (in security-portfolio)](https://github.com/Archer7Mi/security-portfolio/tree/main/ISO27001) | Policies/templates, risk register, Statement of Applicability (SoA). |
| [SC-200 work (in security-portfolio)](https://github.com/Archer7Mi/security-portfolio/tree/main/SC-200) | KQL, hunting notes, and incident-style writeups. |

## Projects (General Engineering)

These show my **build and problem-solving abilities outside strict security contexts**, but still technical and outcome-driven.

| Repo | What you’ll see |
|------|----------------|
| IRIS Simulator *(coming soon)* | Interactive offensive security learning platform. |
| [invictus-dashboard](https://github.com/Archer7Mi/invictus-dashboard) | Dashboards, visualizations, performance tracking, automation. |
| [Other projects](https://github.com/Archer7Mi?tab=repositories) | Smaller scripts/tools/apps as I publish them. |

## Fitness (Professional Tech Apps)

These highlight my **fitness/health tech projects**, where I merge software development with real-world gym workflows.

| Repo | What you’ll see |
|------|----------------|
| invictus-transformations *(private repo)* | Training plans, progress tracking, client workflow. |
| Lead Magnet Calculators *(coming soon)* | Calorie & macro calculators, interactive tools for users. |
| Fitness Analytics *(coming soon)* | Data analysis and visualizations for training metrics. |

## How I Build & Learn

- I stay **hands-on**: labs, dashboards, and simulations to test concepts.
- I focus on **documentation**: case studies and templates show my thinking, not just results.
- I keep things **offline-first and evidence-driven**: writeups, screenshots, and (safe) log snippets.
